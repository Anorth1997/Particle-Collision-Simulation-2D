# Particle-Collision-Simulation-2D

This is a Particles Collision Simulation project in 2D grids. The particles start with initial speed and move in random direction. They bounce back when two or more particles collide. 

This project implements multi-threading in OpenMP and multi-processing in MPI to speed up the performance of the simulation.
